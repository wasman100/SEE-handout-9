1. Primitive vs. Objects
Let's say a student writes the following line of code in a predicate method (i.e., a method
that returns a boolean):
public boolean IsNameQ() {
String name = readLine("Enter name: ");
return (name == "Q");
}
The author of this code thinks that the program will return true if the player’s name is
"Q". What’s the problem here?
Now consider if the code were written as:
public boolean IsNameQ() {
String name = readLine("Enter name: ");
char ch = name.charAt(0);
return ((ch == 'Q') && (name.length() == 1));
}
How is the code above different with respect to checking for equality with the value "Q"?

the difference is with the char value the you ar checking that the first letter in name is capital Q and also checking it's length 
where as the string name would need name.equals("Q")
